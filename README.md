## üåå Overview

This simulation visualizes how light rays are deflected by the intense gravitational field of a black hole, demonstrating the fascinating phenomenon of gravitational lensing predicted by Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. Multiple colored light rays travel from the left side of the screen toward a central black hole, where they follow realistic curved trajectories based on actual physics equations.

## üéì Educational Background

The physics concepts and equations implemented in this simulation were learned from:
**Physics 161: Black Holes** by **Kim Griest**

This course provided the theoretical foundation for understanding:
- General Relativity principles
- Schwarzschild geometry
- Gravitational lensing effects
- Light ray deflection calculations
- Event horizon physics
